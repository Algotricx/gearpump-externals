# gearpump-externals ![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gearpump/gearpump-externals.svg?branch=master)
This is home for a group of projects that connect gearpump with external systems like Kafka, Hadoop and HBase. 

It is decomposed from the [main repo](https://github.com/gearpump/gearpump) following Gearpump's retirement from [Apache Incubator](https://github.com/apache/incubator-gearpump). 

I'd like to highlight that this is work of [many Gearpump committers and contributors](https://github.com/apache/incubator-gearpump/graphs/contributors) and I'm sorry that previous commits can't be carried along.
